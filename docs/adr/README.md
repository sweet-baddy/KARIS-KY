> **Reading order for v5 → v6:** Read [ADR-007](ADR-007-storage-key-evolution.md) (policy, `Rule 5`) first for the high-level additive-key policy; then read [ADR-009](ADR-009-per-investor-persistent-storage.md) for the dedicated rationale, TTL/footprint tradeoffs, and the operator-facing v5 → v6 redeploy plan.

> **Reading order for scaling (10k+ investors):** Read [ADR-010](ADR-010-batch_fund-design.md) for multi-investor funding patterns, then see `docs/arch/sharding-architecture.md` for the optional investor storage sharding architecture that enables unbounded cardinality.

Each ADR links directly to the relevant sections of [`escrow/src/lib.rs`](../../escrow/src/lib.rs).
